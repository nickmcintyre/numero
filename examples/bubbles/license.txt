The "wind tunnel" entry/exit conditions are inspired by Graham Pullan's code
(http://www.many-core.group.cam.ac.uk/projects/LBdemo.shtml).  Additional inspiration from 
Thomas Pohl's applet (http://thomas-pohl.info/work/lba.html).  Other portions of code are based 
on Wagner (http://www.ndsu.edu/physics/people/faculty/wagner/lattice_boltzmann_codes/) and
Gonsalves (http://www.physics.buffalo.edu/phy411-506-2004/index.html; code adapted from Succi,
http://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-lattice-boltzmann-equation-9780199679249).

Revision history:
First version, with only start/stop, speed, and viscosity controls, February 2013
Added resolution control, mouse interaction, plot options, etc., March 2013
Added sensor, contrast slider, improved tracer placement, Fy period readout, May 2013
Added option to animate using setTimeout instead of requestAnimationFrame, July 2013
Added "Flowline" plotting (actually just line segments), August 2013

Still to do:
* Fix the apparent bug in the force calculation that gives inconsistent results depending
    on initial conditions.  Perhaps bounce-backs between adjacent barrier sites don't cancel?
* Grabbing the sensor while "drag fluid" selected causes a momentary drag at previous mouse location.
* Try to pass two-fingered touch events on to the browser, so it's still possible to zoom in and out.
* Work on GUI control layout, especially for smaller screens.
* Treat ends symmetrically when flow speed is zero.
* Try some other visualization techniques.
